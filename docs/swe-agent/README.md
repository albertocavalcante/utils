# SWE-agent

SWE-agent is an AI coding assistant that can solve software engineering tasks by interacting with code repositories.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SWE-agent/SWE-agent.git && cd SWE-agent && uv pip install --editable .
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the full repository clone instead of `uv tool install` as SWE-agent requires config files that are only available in the full repository.

After installation, verify with:

```sh
sweagent --help
```
